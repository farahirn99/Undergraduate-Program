<p>In each lab course, some assignments will be provided which have to be solved by the students individually or in a group. The total number assignments given per lab course will be determined by the respective lab teachers. Each assignment has to be submitted during the lab time on the same day as the assigning date or some time later on a different day which will be determined by the respective lab teachers. For late submission, there will be some sort of penalty which will also be determined by the respective lab teachers. There can be bonus marking, if needed and felt necessary by the respective lab teachers</li>

<li><b>Attendance:</b> Students with 75% attendance and above in each course will be eligible to sit for the semester final examinations.

<li><b>Course Coordinator: </b>Each academic year will have a course coordinator. The coordinator will prepare class routine, arrange, monitor classes, arrange extra classes if necessary, ensure smooth functioning of the academic works, and help the Chairman (of the examination committee) in holding examinations and publishing results.</li>
<li><b>Class Representative: </b>Each batch/section of students will have two class representatives (one male and one female) to maintain liaison with the Course Coordinator regarding their class progress and problems.</li>


<li><b>Promotion and the Final Degree:</b>
<ol class="lowerAlpha">
<li>The minimum CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) 2.00, 2.25, 2.5 will be required for promotion from 2nd, 4th, 6th semester to the next respectively (year to year promotion).</li>
<li>CGPA = ∑ G<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub> ÷ ∑ C<sub>i</sub>, where, G<sub>i</sub> is the grade point obtained in course i and C<sub>i</sub> is the corresponding credit.</li>
<li>The minimum GP of 2.00 is required in each theory course and an overall CGPA of 2.5 will be required for award of the B. Sc. Degree.</li>
<li>The Degree must be earned within the limit of 12 semesters, i.e. 6 academic years from the date of admission to the 1st semester.</li>
<li>There will be no option for grace.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Re-admission and Drop Out:</b>
<ol class="lowerAlpha">
<li>A student failing to get promotion may seek re-admission to study with the following batch. In the case of re-admission, all previously earned grades for the two semesters of that year will be cancelled.</li>
<li>A student may take re-admission only 2 times. If required, a student may take re-admission in the same class, but the Degree must be completed within 6 years.</li>
<li>A student failing to get minimum required CGPA even after taking re-admission twice will be dropped out of the program.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Improvement of Grades:</b>
<ol class="lowerAlpha">
<li>A student will be allowed maximum of 2 chances to clear F grade/grades with the immediate next batches by complying with the time requirement for the degree including final year (4th year). A student will not be allowed for grade improvement once s/he is eligible for the degree. During the extra period for clearing F grades student will not be allowed to remain in residential halls.</li>
<li>A student getting F grade in any theory course (courses) has to attend only the final examination for that (those) course (courses).</li>
<li>A student may improve grade/grades of any course only once by reappearing at the examination with the immediate next batch if he/she obtains a grade less than or equal to C+ (GP = 2.50) and the best grade that a student can achieve in case of grade improvement is B+.</li>
<li>In addition to the usual fees, a fine, as per university rules, will be imposed for each course chosen for improvement.</li>
<li>A student will have to be mentally prepared to take the examination of a particular course chosen for improvement even if it is held on the same day of his/her other regular examination.</li>
